                <p class="para paragraph">A military, also known collectively as armed forces, is a heavily armed,
                    highly organized force primarily intended for warfare. It is typically officially authorized and
                    maintained by a sovereign state, with its members identifiable by their distinct military uniform.
                    It may consist of one or more military branches such as an army, navy, air force, space force,
                    marines, or coast guard. The main task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state
                    and its interests against external armed threats.

                    In broad usage, the terms armed forces and military are often treated as synonymous, although in
                    technical usage a distinction is sometimes made in which a country's armed forces may include both
                    its military and other paramilitary forces. There are various forms of irregular military forces,
                    not belonging to a recognized state; though they share many attributes with regular military forces,
                    they are less often referred to as simply military.


                    Countries by number of active soldiers (2009)
                    A nation's military may function as a discrete social subculture, with dedicated infrastructure such
                    as military housing, schools, utilities, logistics, hospitals, legal services, food production,
                    finance, and banking services. Beyond warfare, the military may be employed in additional sanctioned
                    and non-sanctioned functions within the state, including internal security threats, population
                    control, the promotion of a political agenda, emergency services and reconstruction, protecting
                    corporate economic interests, social ceremonies and national honour guards.[1]

                    The profession of soldiering as part of a military is older than recorded history itself.[2] Some of
                    the most enduring images of classical antiquity portray the power and feats of its military leaders.
                    The Battle of Kadesh in 1274 BC was one of the defining points of Pharaoh Ramses II's reign, and his
                    monuments commemorate it in bas-relief. A thousand years later, the first emperor of unified China,
                    Qin Shi Huang, was so determined to impress the gods with his military might that he had himself
                    buried with an army of terracotta soldiers.[3] The Romans paid considerable attention to military
                    matters, leaving to posterity many treatises and writings on the subject, as well as many lavishly
                    carved triumphal arches and victory columns.</p>
